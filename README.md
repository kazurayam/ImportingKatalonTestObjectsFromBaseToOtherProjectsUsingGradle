# Importing Katalon TestObjects from a base project into other working projects using Gradle

## Background

koushik.kannan posted a question to Katalon User forum, with title [Is there a way to override findTestObject method](https://forum.katalon.com/t/is-there-a-way-to-override-findtestobject-method/142370).
His question inspired me. I have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kazurayam/ImportingKatalonTestObjectsFromBaseToOtherProjectsUsingGradle) where 2 Katalon projects are . I would explain here what I made.

## Problem to solve
